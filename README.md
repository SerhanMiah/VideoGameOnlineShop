# VideoGameOnlineShop


# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Video Game Shop System with a backend built using ASP.NET, LINQ queries, and C#, and a frontend implemented in TypeScript and Angular. The system will manage video games, user profiles, and their relationships, including one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

## Phase

This project consisted of four phase

### Planning the Project: Building a Solid Foundation:

In the inaugural phase of our exciting Video Game Management System project, we embarked on a journey to create a robust backend infrastructure. This journey was not just about code; it was about envisioning, designing, and organizing the very essence of our application. We turned to the digital canvas of Excalidraw to sketch out our dreams.

## Laying the Groundwork with Excalidraw:

Imagine the power of Excalidraw—a digital playground where we visualized the architecture of our application. It was here that we designed and meticulously organized the essential models and classes that would form the backbone of our system. We outlined the relationships between video games, user profiles, and more, ensuring that every piece would fit seamlessly into the puzzle.


## Embracing the Power of SQL Server:

For our data storage needs, we chose SQL Server—a dependable companion on our journey. With SQL Server, we could create and manage our local database, providing a stable foundation for our application's data.

## NuGet Packages and JWT:

To supercharge our backend, we harnessed the incredible capabilities of NuGet packages. These packages became our tools, empowering us to streamline tasks, enhance security, and accelerate development. Among them, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) stood out as our trusty guardian, ensuring the utmost security for user authentication.

Our journey was just beginning, but it was already filled with promise and potential. With a clear plan, a vision translated into Excalidraw sketches, and the technology stack we needed, we were ready to dive headfirst into the exciting world of backend development for our Video Game Management System.
